PLEASE NOTE THAT I HAD TO USE "SESSIONS" AS I HAVE IMPLEMENTED CAPTCHA VERIFICATION. 
THE SESSION IS ONLY APPLIED FOR CAPTCHA VERIFICATION AND NOTHING ELSE. 
I HAVE TAKEN UTMOST CARE OF ALL THE INSTRUCTIONS MENTIONED.
HOWEVER, AS A "PHP EXPERT" (AND AS MENTIONED IN THE INSTRUCTIONS TO THINK SOMETHING OUT OF THE BOX TO MAKE THE FORM MORE SECURE), 
I DECIDED TO IMPLEMENT CAPTCHA HERE. I HOPE THAT'S OKAY.
ALSO, A LITTLE BIT OF JAVASCRIPT IS USED FOR REFRESHING THE CAPTCHA ONLY. NO JS VALIDATIONS DONE.



SECURITY FEATURES ADDED TO THE FORM

1. Captcha verification to prevent bots. Captcha can be refreshed if unreadable by clicking on "Refresh Image" below the captcha.

2. Each input is checked for empty submission (all fields are required).

3. Name input checks if there are any special characters or digits.

4. Phone number input checks for alphabets and string length of 10 digits.

5. Email is validated to have correct format ensuring less chances of entering fake emails.

6. Form submission checks for duplicate submission.

7. Used PDO as it is automatically capable of preventing SQL Injections. Thereby eliminating the need to further sanitize the inputs.




OTHER FEATURES

1. Neat and clean coding. Used standard coding practises.

2. Sends email on successful form submission (not checked as SMTP is not configured on my localhost).

3. Used colors to distinguish between error and success messages.

4. Used a little bit of styling on the form to make it look somewhat elegant.

5. Smart approaches used whereever possible.
